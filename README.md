**_Description_**

_Dunk Tank_ is a modern day, less problematic version of the game _Hangman_. It will follow a similar structure in which the user will guess which letters spell out the word. There will be an image of a person sitting above a dunk tank. For every incorrect guess, the person above the tank will sink lower into the water. If the user cannot guess the correct letters to spell the word in a pre-detemined number of guesses, the person will be fully submerged underwater and a message will display something along the lines of: "You've been dunked!" Accompanied a play again button for the user to play the game again. When the user is able to spell the word through correct guesses, a winning message will display with the play again button. When pressed the play again button will result in the person being placed above the dunk tank with a new word selected and the number of guesses for the user reset to zero.
